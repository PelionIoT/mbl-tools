Entry point.

This script can be called from command line, or used from the mbl-tools.
In short:
* It receives a json formatted file with entries of 2 types :
1) New branch/tag to be created and pushed to remote for Arm MRRs or Arm
    external repositories
2) New branch/tag/commit hash to replace in manifest files for non-Arm MRRs.

* Clones all repositories of type 1), create branch/tag and push to remote
* Update armmbed/mbl-manifest repository manifest XML files accordingly,
    commit and push to remote
* Update
    armmbed/meta-mbl/meta-mbl-distro/conf/dist/mbl-linked-repositories.conf
    accordingly, commit and push to remote.

The script supports:
* diagnostic mode requires user confirmation for each step
* Simulation mode - no real pushes are done to remote.
* temporary folder can be kept for analyzing
* At the end, a summary is printed to screen.
* Execution is accelerated at some parts by using thread pools.
