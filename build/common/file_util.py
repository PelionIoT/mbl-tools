):
    r"""
    Create or replace a section bounded by marker comments in a file.

    This context manager is to make it easy to automatically add a section to a
    text file, bounded by marker comments, or replace a previously added
    section (bounded by marker comments) in a file.

    This context manager:
    * Sets up a temporary file.
    * Copies lines from the original file into the temporary file until it
      finds a BEGIN marker or the end of the file is reached. If it doesn't
      find a begin marker it adds one to the end of the file.
    * Writes a comment line to the temporary file stating the time that the
      file is being modified.
    * Yields a file-like object for writing to the temporary file to the "with"
      block.
    * Ignores any lines from the original file that appear before an END
      marker.
    * Writes an end marker to the end of the temporary file if the section
      didn't previously exist.
    * Atomically replaces the original file with the temporary file.

    Mandatory args:
    * path (PathLike): path to the file to modify.
    * section_name (str): a string added to marker comments to distinguish
      between different sections.

    Optional args:
    * tmpdir (PathLike): the path to a directory in which to create temporary
      files. This directory must be on the same file system as the file to
      modify. The default value, None, means "pathlib.Path(path).parent" in
      order to ensure that the directory is on the right file system.
    * comment_leader (str): A string that starts line comments in the file
      to modify. All lines automatically added by this context manager will
      start with comment_leader.

    Example:
    To create or replace a section with name "Foo config" in a file
    "/path/to/file.conf", (which uses ";" to begin line comments) you could
    write something like:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    with replace_section_in_file(
        "/path/to/file.conf",
        "Foo config",
        comment_leader=";"
    ) as foo_section:
        foo_section.write("enable foo\n")
        foo_section.write("foo_setting_x=bar\n")
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The file will end up with a section something like:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ; BEGIN_AUTOGENERATED_SECTION: Foo config
    ; Last modified: 2019-04-18T11:06:54.177639
